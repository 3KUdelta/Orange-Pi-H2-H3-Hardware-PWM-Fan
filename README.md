# OrangePi Zero (H2+ H3) Hardware PWM-Fan control
How to control a PWM fan depending on CPU temperature on a OrangePi Zero (H2+ / H3)

This solution requires Python - best with V 3.7 or later. All examples are done with V 3.7.

This was developed and tested on an OrangePi Zero. Most likely it will work on any H2+ and H3 chip solutions. The only thing to bare in mind is that you need to use PWM0 pin. On the OPi Zero (or on PC+) board this is the middle pin of the Debug TTL UART pins (the tree pins that stand alone). 

Step 1:
Make sure you run the most recent software:



Actiate HW pwm on your Orange Pi.
